# Oroonoko
This is the XML file of the 1688 edition of Aphra Behn's Oroonoko for ENEC 8600 to edit collaboratively. The text is taken from the Text Creation Partnership's public release of texts from the Early English Books Online database. This digital copy was ultimately derived from the copy of the first edition of Behn's work now at the Henry Huntington Library in San Marino, California.
